/// @notice Circuit to verify input email matches Twitter password reset email, and extract the username
/// @param maxHeadersLength Maximum length for the email header.
/// @param maxBodyLength Maximum length for the email body.
/// @param n Number of bits per chunk the RSA key is split into. Recommended to be 121.
/// @param k Number of chunks the RSA key is split into. Recommended to be 17.
/// @param exposeFrom Flag to expose the from email address (not necessary for verification). We don't expose `to` as its not always signed.
/// @input emailHeader Email headers that are signed (ones in `DKIM-Signature` header) as ASCII int[], padded as per SHA-256 block size.
/// @input emailHeaderLength Length of the email header including the SHA-256 padding.
/// @input pubkey RSA public key split into k chunks of n bits each.
/// @input signature RSA signature split into k chunks of n bits each.
/// @input emailBody Email body after the precomputed SHA as ASCII int[], padded as per SHA-256 block size.
/// @input emailBodyLength Length of the email body including the SHA-256 padding.
/// @input bodyHashIndex Index of the body hash `bh` in the emailHeader.
/// @input precomputedSHA Precomputed SHA-256 hash of the email body till the bodyHashIndex.
/// @input twitterUsernameIndex Index of the Twitter username in the email body.
/// @input address ETH address as identity commitment (to make it as part of the proof).
/// @output pubkeyHash Poseidon hash of the pubkey - Poseidon(n/2)(n/2 chunks of pubkey with k*2 bits per chunk).
